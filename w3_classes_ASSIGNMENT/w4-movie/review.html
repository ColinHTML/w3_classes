            <h2><b>Colin Lauro</b> <i>February 7, 2024</i></h2>
            <p>I was young when this movie first aired and it quickly became my all time favorite. I enjoyed the simplistic plot design that contains the usual protagonist, antagonist, and deuteragonists. The plot goes through the exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution effectively for my young mind to understand, and I fell in love with the story of <em>Wall-e</em> trying to override the evil axiom computer to prove to humans that the earth was able to be habitable once again. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Altough it was created to be a childrens movie, there are many underlying meanings within the movie to help educate the audience such as the risk of making our planet uninhabitable or the rapid growth of technology and the risks that come with it. Overall, it is truly an incredible movie that I would highly recommend for any person to view.</p>
